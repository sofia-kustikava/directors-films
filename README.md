> Secondly, we need to run **GenerateDB.sql** to create database objects and fill tables with the data.
File **GenerateDB.sql** is located in ./src/main/resources/GenerateDB.sql
> And finally, we are going to run our application. We need to run **GodelApplication.java**
File **GodelApplication.java** is located in/src/main/java/com/film/godel/GodelApplication.java
